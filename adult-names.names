| Split into train-test using MLC++ GenCVFiles (2/3, 1/3 random).
| 48842 instances, mix of continuous and discrete    (train=32561, test=16281)
| 45222 if instances with unknown values are removed (train=30162, test=15060)
| Duplicate or conflicting instances : 6
| Class probabilities for adult.all file
| Probability for the label '>50K'  : 23.93% / 24.78% (without unknowns)
| Probability for the label '<=50K' : 76.07% / 75.22% (without unknowns)
|
| Extraction was done by Barry Becker from the 1994 Census database.  A set of
|   reasonably clean records was extracted using the following conditions:
|   ((AAGE>16) && (AGI>100) && (AFNLWGT>1)&& (HRSWK>0))
|
| Prediction task is to determine whether a person makes over 50K
| a year.

| Error Accuracy reported as follows, after removal of unknowns from
|    train/test sets):
|    C4.5       : 84.46+-0.30
|    Naive-Bayes: 83.88+-0.30
|    NBTree     : 85.90+-0.28
|
|
| Following algorithms were later run with the following error rates,
|    all after removal of unknowns and using the original train/test split.
|    All these numbers are straight runs using MLC++ with default values.

| Conversion of original data as follows:
| 1. Discretized agrossincome into two ranges with threshold 50,000.
| 2. Convert U.S. to US to avoid periods.
| 3. Convert Unknown to "?"
| 4. Run MLC++ GenCVFiles to generate data,test.
|
| Description of fnlwgt (final weight)
|
| The weights on the CPS files are controlled to independent estimates of the
| civilian noninstitutional population of the US.  These are prepared monthly
| for us by Population Division here at the Census Bureau.  We use 3 sets of
| controls.
|  These are:
|          1.  A single cell estimate of the population 16+ for each state.
|          2.  Controls for Hispanic Origin by age and sex.
|          3.  Controls by Race, age and sex.
|
| We use all three sets of controls in our weighting program and "rake" through
| them 6 times so that by the end we come back to all the controls we used.
|
| The term estimate refers to population totals derived from CPS by creating
| "weighted tallies" of any specified socio-economic characteristics of the
| population.
|
| People with similar demographic characteristics should have
| similar weights.  There is one important caveat to remember
| about this statement.  That is that since the CPS sample is
| actually a collection of 51 state samples, each with its own
| probability of selection, the statement only applies within
| state.
