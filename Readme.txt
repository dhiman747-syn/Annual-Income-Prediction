The Task is to predict income status of people - whether it is less than or equal to $50,000 or greater than $50,000.

I have used the "adult" dataset from "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult". Used the "adult.data" dataset.

I have done some data cleaning and data visualization.

Tried to use different classifiers and compare them.

Lastly, I used a voting classifier by including the better performing models.
